[ INSTRUCTIONS ]

in the "questions.txt" file there are questions and answers

you can add them but keep in mind the format:

        question | answer | difficulty

the separator "|" is needed for parsing so if you know C++ remember to modify the parsing method in the Deck class
else, just write your question with relative answer and a number from 1 to 3 (1 is easy - 3 is hard)
